**{{{Here The main event fight to watch is Alexander Volkanovski vs Diego Lopes** in a title bout for the vacant featherweight title at UFC 314 
on Oct 13, 2023. Here’s a humanized take on their matchup:
Alexander Volkanovski: The Experienced Challenger in Search of Redemption
Volkanovski, a former UFC featherweight champion, is running the gauntlet to win back his title following a tumultuous stretch. At 36, he comes with a right-sized trio of hurdles in career back-to-back knockouts to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria. Even with these setbacks, Volkanovski is still optimistic for his chances due to experience and tactical warfare being his greatest advantages. His incentive is not just personal — he fights for his family, which includes a new addition on the way, and to justify his doubters.
Overall, Volkanovski looks to employ his footwork to minimize Lopes' aggression and break the native Brazilian down as the fight goes on. He thinks Lopes’ aggressive style, though dangerous, could also be his undoing if he becomes careless in search of a finish.

At 30, Diego Lopes has shot up the featherweight ranks on a five-fight tear. His road to this title fight started with an audacious move to take on Movsar Evloev on short notice, a loss that nonetheless demonstrated his potential. Grappling has been the Achilles heel in his otherwise scarf skin and the combatory beast known as Lopes has 12 submissions in his career.
Everything about Lopes' mentality is focused on opportunities and risk. He considers this battle a culmination of his toil and grit, and follows suit with confidence he can exploit recent vulnerabilities displayed by Volkanovski. Lopes probably plans to continue fighting aggressively to land the kill-shot on Volkanovski during the opening rounds.
The Clash of Styles
This one features two disparate approaches: Volkanovski is a tactician, Lopes is destructive and explosive. An outcome which will likely hinge on whether Volkanovski has the ability to avoid Lopes early pressure and take advantage of his opponent's likely cardio issues in the later rounds. On the other hand, Lopes can hold up his pace and hit an important hit, with which he loads a Draw and earns the title.
High stakes await both fighters: Volkanovski is looking for redemption while Lopes is going for his maiden UFC title. It is sure to be an interesting collision of generations and fighting philosophies.
